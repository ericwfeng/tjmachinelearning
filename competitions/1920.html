                       <p><i>12/11/19 -&emsp;</i>
                           Your job is to write the code to create an neural network, train it on the training data, and use it to predict the classes of the testing data. This time, we'll be using data from the famous MNIST dataset.
                           MNIST has 28x28 pixel images of handwritten numerical digit, which means 784 different features, each representing one pixel of the image.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                           Your neural network should predict the handwritten digit, outputting a number from <code>0-9</code>, based on these 784 input pixels.
                           Each pixel is described by a single <code>0-255</code> number representing its intensity (0 being a completely white pixel, 125 being a gray-ish pixel, and 255 being a fully black pixel).
                           Note: the numbers represented will probably contain relatively intense pixels near the center of the stroke, but have pixels fading in intensity on the borders of the stroke of the number.
                       </p>
                      <h4>The Data</h4>
                      <p>With that in mind, the training data now looks like this:</p>
                        <p>
                         <code>
                            class (digit), n1, n2, n3, n4 ... n784<br>
                            0, 0, 0, 130, 255 ... 120<br>
                            9, 0, 10, 101, 87 ... 9<br>
                            3, 230, 0, 5, 35 ... 1<br>
                            1, 90, 0, 0, 90 ... 23<br>
                            1, 80, 70, 100, 5 ... 167<br>
                            etc. (27629 lines) <br>
                        </code>
                        </p>
                        <p>and the testing data looks like this: </p>
                        <p>
                        <code>
                            id, n1, n2, n3, n4 ... n784<br>
                            1, 0, 0, 130, 255 ... 120<br>
                            2, 0, 10, 101, 87 ... 9<br>
                            3, 230, 0, 5, 35 ... 1<br>
                            4, 90, 0, 0, 90 ... 23<br>
                            5, 80, 70, 100, 5 ... 167<br>
                            etc. (10000 lines) <br>
                        </code>
                            </p>
                       <p>Your end file should be a <code>.csv</code> like this:<br>
                        <code>
                        id, number <br>
                        1, predicted_class <br>
                        2, predicted_class <br>
                        3, predicted_class <br>
                        4, predicted_class <br>
                        etc. (10000 lines) <br>
                        </code>
                        (For every set of features in line N in the training data, you should have a line <code>N, predicted_class</code> in your submission file.)</p>

                        <h4>Guidelines</h4>
                        <p>We highly recommend you open both the training and testing csv files in a program like Excel, which will help you modify columns of data and perform calculations quickly.</p>

                        <p>As always, use Python for this competition. <strong>The only external libraries allowed are Numpy and Pandas.

                        <p>We've written a <a href="../contests/1920/nn/nn_shell.py.txt" target="_blank">small shell</a>. The shell has a network class, and each network is made up of a list of layers (which are a separate class). Each layer is designed to have its own vectors and matrices (biases and weights, etc.). You don't have to structure your network this way by any means, or have a layer class at all. Most of the time when people write neural networks from scratch, they only have a single network class.</p>

                       <p><i>10/23/19 -&emsp;</i>This competition is a harder version of the Random Forests competition.
                           Your job is to write the code to create an SVM, train it on the training data, and use it to predict the classes of the testing data.
                           The goal is to classify survival of passengers on the Titanic, and the data we are using are from actual passengers on the ship.
                           Your random forest is supposed to classify whether a passenger survived <code>RIP (0) or Survived (1)</code>, based on 11 different metrics (features).</p>
                       <p>The purpose of this contest is not to test your ability to write an SVM. Instead, this contests mostly tests:</p>
                      <ol>
                          <li>Your ability to use Scikit-Learn</li>
                          <li>Your ability to work with real-world data</li>
                      </ol>
                      <p>The second is far more important (and difficult) than the first.</p>

                      <h4>The Data</h4>
                      <p>With that in mind, the training data now looks like this:</p>
                        <p>
                         <code>

                            feature 1, survival, feature 2, feature 3, feature 4, feature 5, feature 6, feature 7, feature 8, feature 9, feature 10, feature 11<br>
                            feature 1, survival, feature 2, feature 3, feature 4, feature 5, feature 6, feature 7, feature 8, feature 9, feature 10, feature 11<br>
                            etc. (636 lines) <br></code>
                        </p>
                        <p>and the testing data looks like this: </p>
                        <p>
                        <code>

                            feature 1, feature 2, feature 3, feature 4, feature 5, feature 6, feature 7, feature 8, feature 9, feature 10, feature 11<br>

                            etc. (255 lines) <br>
                        </code>
                            </p>
                       <p>Your end file should be a <code>.csv</code> like this:<br>
                        <code>
                        id, solution <br>
                        1, predicted_class <br>

                        etc. (255 lines) <br>
                        </code>
                        (For every set of features in line N in the training data, you should have a line <code>N, predicted_class</code> in your submission file.)</p>

                        <h4>Guidelines</h4>
                        <p><strong>There are missing data points. Some features are not useful. </strong> The difficult part of this contest is formatting the data given, determining which features are useful, which ones should be trained on, and how to deal with the missing data.</p>
                        <p>You are allowed to (and should) use <a href="http://www.scikit-learn.org">Scikit-Learn</a> to create your SVM. Scikit has detailed instructions on how to write an SVM using the library <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm">here</a>.</p>

                        Your random forest is supposed to classify whether a passenger survived <code>RIP (0) or Survived (1)</code>, based on 7 different metrics (features).
                        </p>

                        <h4>The Data</h4>
                        <p>The training data looks like this: </p>
                        <p>
                        <code>
                        feature 1, feature 2, feature 3, feature 4, feature 5, feature 6, feature 7, survival<br>
                        feature 1, feature 2, feature 3, feature 4, feature 5, feature 6, feature 7, survival<br>
                        feature 1, feature 2, feature 3, feature 4, feature 5, feature 6, feature 7, survival<br>
                        etc. (500 lines) <br></code>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        and the testing data looks like this: </p>
                        <p>
                        <code>

                        <p>
                        Your end file should be a <code>.csv</code> like this: <br>
                        <code>
                        id, solution <br>

                        (For every set of features in line N in the training data, you should have a line <code>N, predicted_class</code> in your submission file.)
                        </p>

                        <h4>Guidelines</h4>

                        <p><i>10/2/19 -&emsp;</i>Welcome to the first contest of the year! Your job is to write the code to create a decision tree, train it on the training data, and use it to predict the classes of the testing data.
                        We are trying to classify breast cancer data. The data we are using is actual data from breast cancer patients.
                        Your decision tree is supposed to classify the type of breast cancer they have (benign (0) or malignant (1)), based on 9 different metrics (features).

                        <h4>Some More Guidelines:</h4>
                        <ol>
                        <li>We recommend that you use Python. Everything we do is in Python this year, and it's the main language for machine learning in general. Don't use any external libraries, other than numpy and pandas. Both of these packages are very useful for data processing and manipulation, so it's a good idea to learn them if you can. If you're unfamiliar with Python, for this competition, you can use whichever language you want to, but in the future it will be much more difficult.

                        If it's your first time using Python, check out these links for a jumpstart:
                        <a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/" target="_blank">Google's Python course</a>,
                        <a href="https://www.learnpython.org/" target="_blank">LearnPython.org</a>, and
                        <a href="https://thepythonguru.com/" target="_blank">The Python Guru</a>.

                        </li><li>The Competition ends at 11:59:00 PM, October 15th. For this competition, we're giving an extra week than we normally do, so be sure to try it out!
                        </li><li>The leaderboard on Kaggle that you can see is the Public Leaderboard, which is your accuracy for 50% of the testing data. Your final rankings will be based on the Private leaderboard, which is based on the other 50% of the testing data and will become public as soon as the competition ends. This is to prevent you from just writing a decision tree that overfits the testing data, which defeats the purpose.
